# Task 1: Data Quality Assessment

**Objective:** Assess the quality and completeness of the data in preparation for analysis. The goal is to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and reliable for generating meaningful insights.

### Key Areas of Focus:

1. **Customer Demographics:**
   - Verify the accuracy of demographic details such as age, gender, income, occupation, and other key demographic characteristics.
   - Identify any missing or inconsistent values in customer records, such as blank fields or conflicting data (e.g., invalid age or income ranges).
   - Evaluate the consistency of data formatting (e.g., date formats, numerical values) across all records.

2. **Customer Addresses:**
   - Ensure that all customer addresses are correctly formatted and standardized.
   - Check for missing or incomplete address information (e.g., missing postal codes or city names).
   - Assess the geographic distribution of customers and ensure the addresses align with the company’s service area or delivery zones.

3. **Transaction Data (Past 3 Months):**
   - Examine transaction data for completeness, including verifying that all customer purchases, returns, and interactions within the past three months are recorded.
   - Ensure that there are no duplicate or erroneous transactions (e.g., duplicated orders or incorrect transaction amounts).
   - Check for outliers or anomalies in transaction data (e.g., unusually high or low purchase values) that may skew the analysis.

# Task 2: Data Insights

**Objective:** Leverage customer demographics and transaction data to target high-value customers and identify key customer trends that can inform marketing strategies.

### Analysis Focus:

1. **Targeting High-Value Customers:**
   - Use customer demographics (e.g., age, income, location) and purchasing behavior (e.g., frequency of purchases, average spend) to identify the high-value customers who contribute most to Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s revenue.
   - Segment customers based on these factors and rank them by lifetime value (LTV) or average transaction value.

2. **Identifying Key Customer Trends and Behavior:**
   - Analyze the buying patterns and behaviors of different customer segments. For example, do certain age groups prefer specific types of products or accessories?
   - Investigate seasonal trends, repeat purchase behavior, and preferences for certain product categories.
   - Identify any correlations between customer demographics and purchasing behavior that could offer actionable insights for the marketing team.

**Objective:** Present insights derived from the data analysis using compelling visualizations to support the marketing strategy and growth plans for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.

### Key Insights to Present:

1. **Trends in the Underlying Data:**
   - Identify significant trends, such as peak purchasing periods, high-demand product categories, and changes in customer behavior over time.
   - Highlight customer segments that are more likely to convert into repeat buyers or those that have the highest engagement with specific products.
   - Visualize trends in customer demographics, such as which age groups or geographic regions are most active.

2. **Customer Segment with the Highest Value:**
   - Based on the analysis, identify which customer segment—whether defined by demographics, purchasing patterns, or behavior—has the highest lifetime value (LTV) or most frequently makes large transactions.
   - Present a clear comparison of different customer segments, illustrating which group generates the highest revenue for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.

3. **Proposed Marketing and Growth Strategy:**
   - Develop targeted marketing strategies based on customer behavior and segment insights. For instance, if younger customers are purchasing more accessories, suggest targeted promotions for this demographic.
   - Recommend strategies for customer retention, such as loyalty programs for high-value customers or personalized marketing campaigns based on purchase history.
   - Propose potential growth areas, such as expanding into underrepresented geographic regions or introducing new products that align with customer preferences.

4. **External Datasets for Greater Insights:**
   - Suggest additional external datasets that could provide deeper insights into customer preferences and purchasing behavior. For example:
     - Market trends or competitor analysis to benchmark performance.
     - Social media sentiment analysis or customer feedback from review platforms to understand the broader sentiment toward cycling products.
     - Demographic data from public sources or third-party providers to expand the customer profile and enhance targeting accuracy.
     - Economic data (e.g., regional income levels, economic growth trends) to correlate with purchasing power and customer behavior.
   - Recommend how integrating these external datasets could lead to more precise customer segmentation, tailored marketing campaigns, and improved forecasting.

# Presentation Format

You may choose to use **Tableau** or **Excel** for your presentation. Here’s a suggestion on how to approach the tools:

- **Excel:** Use Excel for your initial drafts and to organize and manipulate the data before visualizing it. Excel is a great tool for preparing data, creating pivot tables, performing calculations, and doing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). You can create charts and tables that summarize key findings.
  
- **Tableau:** Once your data is ready and insights are derived, use Tableau for final visualizations. Tableau excels in creating interactive dashboards, rich visualizations, and interactive charts that allow your audience to explore the data in more depth. 

Ensure that your visualizations are clear, concise, and tell a compelling story, highlighting the key insights that will guide Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing strategy.

2. **Communication with Stakeholders:**  
   While presenting your insights, remember that the goal is to provide clear, actionable recommendations. Make sure to communicate your findings in a way that resonates with the marketing team and decision-makers at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. Use visuals that clearly demonstrate how the insights will drive business outcomes.
